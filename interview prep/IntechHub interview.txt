Q2. Datatypes

A: In JavaScript, data types define what kind of values a variable can store. They fall into two major categories:

🟦 1. Primitive Data Types

Primitives are simple, immutable values. They are stored directly in memory and compared by value.

✅ 7 Primitive Data Types:
1️⃣ Number

Represents all numbers (integer, float, NaN, Infinity)

let age = 25;
let price = 99.99;

2️⃣ String

Text enclosed in ' ', " ", or `template literals`

let name = "Vishal";

3️⃣ Boolean

Only true or false

let isLoggedIn = true;

4️⃣ Undefined

A variable declared but not assigned any value.

let x;
console.log(x); // undefined

5️⃣ Null

Represents an intentional empty value.

let data = null;

6️⃣ BigInt

Used for very large integers beyond the safe range.

let big = 9007199254740991n;

7️⃣ Symbol

Unique and immutable values, often used as object keys.

let id = Symbol("id");

🟩 2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

These store references (memory addresses) rather than raw values.

1️⃣ Object

Key-value pairs.

let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };

2️⃣ Array

Ordered list of items.

let nums = [1, 2, 3];


Arrays are actually objects internally.

3️⃣ Function

A callable object.

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

🧠 Important Notes
✔️ Primitives are copied by value
let a = 10;
let b = a;
b = 20; 
// a remains 10

✔️ Objects & arrays are copied by reference
let obj1 = {name: "John"};
let obj2 = obj1;
obj2.name = "Mike";

console.log(obj1.name); // Mike

🔥 Special Values
NaN

Not a number:

Number("abc") // NaN

Infinity & -Infinity
1/0  // Infinity
-1/0 // -Infinity

📌 Summary Table
Category	Data Type	Example
Primitive	Number	42
Primitive	String	"Hello"
Primitive	Boolean	true
Primitive	Undefined	undefined
Primitive	Null	null
Primitive	BigInt	100n
Primitive	Symbol	Symbol()
Non-Primitive	Object	{}
Non-Primitive	Array	[]
Non-Primitive	Function	()

Q3. Types of list in HTML

A: Types of Lists in HTML

HTML provides three main types of lists, each used for different purposes:

1️⃣ Ordered List (<ol>)

Used when the order or sequence matters, such as steps, rankings, instructions.

Items are numbered automatically.

Default numbering: 1, 2, 3...

You can change numbering type using type="" (1, A, a, I, i)

Example:
<ol>
  <li>Install Node.js</li>
  <li>Create a project folder</li>
  <li>Initialize npm</li>
</ol>

2️⃣ Unordered List (<ul>)

Used when the order does not matter, like features, menu items, navigation bars.

Bullets appear by default (●, ○, ■)

Style can be customized with CSS.

Example:
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Next.js</li>
  <li>Node.js</li>
</ul>

3️⃣ Definition List (<dl>)

Used for term + description pairs.

Inside it:

<dt> → term

<dd> → description

Typically used for FAQs, glossaries, key-value pairs.

Example:
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>

  <dt>API</dt>
  <dd>Application Programming Interface</dd>
</dl>

💡 Additional Notes (Good to mention in interviews)
✔ Lists can be nested
<ul>
  <li>Frontend
    <ol>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>Next.js</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

✔ Lists improve accessibility and SEO

Screen readers understand lists better, improving structure.

✔ You can style lists using CSS

Remove bullets:

ul {
  list-style: none;
}

✔ Ordered lists can start from any number
<ol start="5">
  <li>Item</li>
</ol>

⭐ Perfect Short Answer for Interview

“HTML supports three types of lists:
(1) Ordered lists (<ol>) used when sequence matters,
(2) Unordered lists (<ul>) used when order doesn’t matter, and
(3) Definition lists (<dl>) used for term–description pairs.
Lists can be nested, styled with CSS, and improve both accessibility and content structure.”

Here’s a 30-second interview version:

“HTML provides three types of lists.
First is the ordered list (<ol>), which shows items in a specific sequence using numbers.
Second is the unordered list (<ul>), which uses bullet points when order doesn’t matter.
And third is the definition list (<dl>), used for term–description pairs like in glossaries.
These lists help structure content better, improve readability, and can be fully styled using CSS.”

Q4: Tell me about css selectors

A: CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements.
They tell the browser which elements to apply styles to.

The main types of CSS selectors are:

1️⃣ Universal Selector (*)

Selects all elements.

* { margin: 0; }

2️⃣ Type Selector (Element Selector)

Selects elements by tag name.

p { color: blue; }

3️⃣ Class Selector (.class)

Selects elements with a specific class.

.card { padding: 10px; }

4️⃣ ID Selector (#id)

Selects a single unique element.

#header { background: black; }

5️⃣ Attribute Selector

Selects elements based on attributes.

input[type="email"] { border: 1px solid red; }

6️⃣ Pseudo-Class Selector

Selects elements in a specific state.

button:hover { background: green; }

7️⃣ Pseudo-Element Selector

Selects part of an element.

p::first-letter { font-size: 30px; }

8️⃣ Combinators

Define relationships between selectors:

Descendant (A B)

Child (A > B)

Adjacent sibling (A + B)

General sibling (A ~ B)

Example:

div > p { color: purple; }

⭐ Perfect 30-second Interview Version

“CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling.
We have basic selectors like universal (*), element, class (.), and ID (#).
We also have attribute selectors for selecting elements based on attributes, pseudo-classes like :hover to style elements in a particular state, and pseudo-elements like ::before to style parts of an element.
Additionally, combinators let us select elements based on relationships—for example, child or sibling selectors.”

Q5: Suspense and lazy loading:

A: Lazy loading in React means loading components only when they are needed, instead of loading everything upfront. This helps reduce the initial bundle size and improves performance. React provides the React.lazy() function to load components dynamically.

Suspense works together with lazy loading. It allows you to show a fallback UI (like a loader or spinner) while the lazy component is being downloaded. Suspense basically waits for the lazy component to finish loading before rendering it.

Together, lazy() + Suspense help optimize performance and make React apps load faster.

✅ Example (Good to mention in interview)
const LazyDashboard = React.lazy(() => import("./Dashboard"));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
      <LazyDashboard />
    </Suspense>
  );
}


Here:

React.lazy() → splits code and loads Dashboard only when needed

<Suspense> → shows “Loading...” until Dashboard loads

🎯 30-Second Version

“React.lazy is used for lazy loading components so they are loaded only when needed, which reduces the initial bundle size. Suspense is the wrapper that shows a fallback UI like a loader while the lazy component is being fetched. Together, they improve app performance by enabling code splitting and avoiding unnecessary loading.”

🎯 10-Second Version

“Lazy loading delays loading components until needed. Suspense provides a fallback UI while those components load.”

If you want, I can also explain how code splitting works internally, or give a Next.js version of the same answer.
