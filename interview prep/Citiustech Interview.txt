Self Introduction (Professional & Confident Tone)

Hi, I’m Vishal. I have around 6 years of experience in software development, primarily focused on building data-driven and real-time web applications.

I started my career at Merisem Industries, where I developed a data acquisition system using Python, MQTT, and MySQL to collect and monitor live industrial machine data. That experience helped me build a strong foundation in backend logic, APIs, and real-time data processing.

Later, at Diksha Solutions, I transitioned into frontend development using React.js, where I built modules like user authentication, dashboards, and responsive interfaces for industrial productivity applications. I also gained hands-on experience integrating APIs and improving UI/UX performance.

In my latest role as an Associate Engineer at Diksha Solutions, I worked on ThingsCode, an ERP-lite application built using the MERN stack. I was responsible for building secure JWT authentication, responsive data visualization with Recharts, and managing global states efficiently using Context API and memoization to optimize rendering.

Alongside my professional experience, I’ve been actively upskilling and building personal projects, including CashTrack, MonitR, and FoodVilla, where I’ve implemented real-time updates using WebSockets, server-side rendering, and deployed full-stack apps using Render and Vercel.

I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and developing scalable, performant front-end applications that deliver a smooth user experience. I’m now looking for a challenging frontend or full-stack role where I can leverage my MERN expertise and continue to grow technically.
